      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Rafael Borges and I am a computer engineer based in Brazil. I have a strong passion for web development and have been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for several years. I have experience creating responsive and dynamic websites, as well as developing interactive user interfaces.

I have already completed several projects and have been able to improve my skills in web development. I am committed to creating well-designed and user-friendly websites that provide a great experience for users.

I am also a good listener and reader of English, which allows me to stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies. My main language is Portuguese, but I am fluent in English and able to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and gain new experiences. If you have a project that requires a dedicated and skilled web developer, I would love to work with you. Please feel free to contact me to discuss your project and see how I can help."</p>
